/**
 * Introduction to Node.js
 *
 * Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript on the server side.
 * It's built on the V8 JavaScript engine and is known for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.
 * Node.js is widely used for web development, creating APIs, and building real-time applications.
 *
 * Key Points:
 * - JavaScript on the server side.
 * - Event-driven, non-blocking I/O.
 * - Rich ecosystem of modules and packages.
 * - Ideal for building scalable and high-performance applications.
 *
 * This is a simple Node.js program that outputs a message to the console.
